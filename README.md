# python-challenge

-For both sections of the challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as asking questions during office hours

-the path to read csvfile and skip the header were taking directly from previous challenges that we had worked on either separately or together during class time with the phyiscal location of where the files were found and the actual csv file to read were changed to fit this assignment

- this is also the case for the output path and for writing the code onto a csv file during the analysis portion of the assignment. Chatgpt was used on how to modify this code from writing an excel csv file to a text file

- during the pybank portion most of the concepts used came from the the vba challange only transcribed into python for this assignement. I did consult friends familiar with python with assistance on storing the income from the previous date in order to find the change in income from date to date while iterating through the csv file

- for the pypoll assignment chatgpt was used to assist with iterating through the first dict to create the second dict that would hold the same key(candidate) but a separte value (percent of votes) in order to be called at the end. the syntax for printing out the percentages correctly was also taken from chatgpt when calling on the values from the second dictionary (percentage of votes).

- overall the Pybank portion of the assignment wasn't too difficult to figure out as. PyPoll was much more challenging but I did overall enjoy it and most of the time on it was spent reviewing lectures on how dictionaries worked.
